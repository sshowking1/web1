<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
is an information system where documents and other web
resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
(URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be
interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the
Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred
via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be
accessed by users by a software application called
a web browser, and are published by a software
application called a web server. The World Wide Web is
not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed
he Web in some form by over two decades and upon which
technologies the Web is built.
